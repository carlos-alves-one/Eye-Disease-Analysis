        " - Countries and Regions: The data covers 196 countries across various regions.\n",
        " - Population: The populations of these countries vary, with some anomalies (negative values, which are likely data errors).\n",
        " - Gender Disparity in Disease Impact: The dataset includes separate counts for males and females affected by the disease.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Key Statistics\n",
        " - Affected Population: The average number of affected males and females per country is 48,730 and 50,088, respectively. This suggests a slightly higher prevalence among females.\n",
        " - Blindness Cases: On average, there are 4,898 male and 5,176 female blindness cases per country, indicating a slightly higher impact on females.\n",
        " - Healthcare Costs and Productivity Loss: These figures are substantial, with average costs of around 479,401 and average productivity loss of around 488,051 per country.\n",
        " - Research Funding: The average research funding per country is approximately 472,043.\n",

        "Recovery and Mortality Rates: The average recovery rate is 53.5%, and the average mortality rate is 55.3%. This indicates a challenging health situation with a significant number of cases leading to mortality.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Treatment and Prevention\n",
        "The data includes information on treatment availability, medical facilities, awareness programs, prevention measures, vaccination, medication, and surgery options. These variables are categorical (Yes/No) and suggest varied approaches to disease management across countries.\n",

        "7. Potential Data Quality Issues\n",
        "The presence of harmful and possibly erroneous data points suggests a need for data cleaning and validation.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. Limitations and Suggestions for Further Analysis\n",
        " - Age Group Analysis: The impact of Glaucoma across different age groups is not analyzed here but could provide valuable insights.\n",
        " - Regional Analysis: Further analysis could reveal regional patterns in disease prevalence, healthcare response, and outcomes.\n",
        " - Correlation Studies: Investigating correlations between variables (e.g., healthcare cost vs. recovery rate) could yield exciting findings.\n",
        " - Time-Series Analysis: If data over time is available, it could help understand trends and interventions' effectiveness.\n",
